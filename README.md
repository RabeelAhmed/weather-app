Weather App 🌤️
On my learning journey of MERN, I built this weather app that fetches real-time weather data using a weather API. The project leverages React concepts such as useEffect, useState, props, and CSS for styling.

Features:
🌍 Displays real-time weather updates for any location.
🌡️ Provides information like temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.
🧩 Fully responsive design with a clean and simple user interface.
🛠️ Built using modern React concepts and integrated with a weather API.

Tech Stack:
React (with Hooks: useState, useEffect)
Weather API (for real-time weather data)
CSS (for styling and responsive design)
